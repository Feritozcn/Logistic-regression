# Logistic Regression with Gradient Descent

## Overview
This project implements logistic regression using gradient descent to classify data. It uses a custom-built gradient descent function to optimize the weights and bias of the logistic regression model. The model is trained on a given dataset to make predictions on a target variable.

## Features
- Logistic regression model with sigmoid activation.
- Gradient descent optimization algorithm.
- Calculation of cost and gradients during training.
- Customizable learning rate and number of epochs.

## Requirements
- Python 3.x
- NumPy
- Pandas
- Matplotlib (for plotting)

You can install the required libraries using pip:

```bash
pip install numpy pandas matplotlib
